# Twitch.tv-D3-Analysis(name pending)


## Background and Overview

Twitch.tv-D3-Analysis(name pending) will be a interactive analysis of Twitch.tv.

Users will be able to see visual data from twitch ranging from numbers of viewers, popularity, most
popular streamer and whatever else the twitch API will let me grab. All data will be pulled from the Twitch API using ajax calls for the most concurrent data possible.

## Functionality & MVP

- [ ] Display table of top 30 games(# of games can be changes)
- [ ] Display D3 bubble chart of those 30 games
- [ ] Each bubble will have a pop up displaying relevant information of each game
- [ ] Display D3 Barchart, possibly might replace with another chart
- [ ] Clicking on anygame from the table will load a summary of that particular game only
